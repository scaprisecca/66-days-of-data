# Welcome!

Thank you for checking out my **66 Days of Data** challenge. This challenge was originally created by Ken Jee. It is focused on building a habit of learning, focused on data science and related topics. 

I am new to data analysis and data science so I will be starting out from the very basics. I have been working on the Google Data Analytics course on coursera so I will be continuing with that to start. 

My goal is to make a quick note documenting what I learn each day and I will post that to this github page. Once I know enough to work on some projects, I will begin to include those resources to help build out my profile. 

As someone new to DA, I would appreciate any helpful feedback or tips you may have.
