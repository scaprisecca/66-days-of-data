# 2022-02-28 - Day 1

Working on the Google Data Analytics certification, currently on Week 3 of Section 4. 

Today I learned more about cleaning data with SQL. I learned about using `DISTINCT` to help filter for unique values only. This can be helpful to see if there are any entries that possibly have leading or trailing space. 

I learned about using `LENGTH`, `SUBSTR()` and `TRIM()` to help with cleaning data or finding data that needs to be cleaned. 

I also learned about using `UPDATE` and `SET` to change data already in the database. 

**Summary:** This was interesting and I'm excited to learn more about SQL so I can start playing around with datasets. I feel that will really help me learn and retain the concepts
