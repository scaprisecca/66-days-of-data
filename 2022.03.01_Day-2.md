# 2022-03-01 - Day 2

Continued with the Google DA course. Went over their section on Advanced Cleaning Functions which consisted of using `CAST` to convert data types, `CONCAT` to add strings together to create unique keys and `COALESCE` to return non-null values.

Started week 4 of section 4 today. Learning about the importance of verification, reporting and documentation/changelogs. 

For Google sheets they recommend using **find and replace**, **pivot tables** and **COUNTA** to help with finding and fixing errors. They also talked about the built-in version history available with sheets. 

For SQL they recommend using `CASE` statements where you can filter and replace certain words if they match the statement. This is something that I am familiar with from JavaScript programming.
