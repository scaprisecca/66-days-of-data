# 2022-03-02 - Day 3

Had a busy day today so I wasn't able to dedicate as much time to studying. Didn't want to break the streak so I watched some videos by StatQuest from their [66 days of data playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&list=PLblh5JKOoLUJUNlfvCNhJMNjNNpt5ljcR). These are short videos covering different topics in statistics. 

This is a great refresher for me since I have not really done any statistics since high school. Today I learned about histograms and distributions. 

Histograms
- divide data points into different buckets
- stack data points that fall into the same bucket
- can be used to predict future data points 
- can be represented with a curve
	- curve is helpful for predicting data points for bins that did not have any actual data
	- allows you to predict data points for very specific bins (even if they were not used in your original bin breakdown)
